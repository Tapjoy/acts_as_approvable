module ActsAsApprovable
  ##
  # This module provides the {Approval} class with the ability to assign records
  # as an "owner" of the approval. This is especially useful for tracking purposes
  # when you require it, and can be beneficial when you have an approval queue with
  # a high rate of insertions.
  #
  # By default the ownership functionality will reference a model named `User` and
  # will allow any user to take ownership of an approval.
  module Ownership
    ##
    # Configure approvals to allow ownership by a User model.
    #
    # If a block is given it will be applied to Approval at the class level,
    # allowing you to override functionality on the fly.
    #
    # @param [Object] approval the explicit model being used for approval records.
    # @param [Object] owner the explicit model being used for owner records.
